## Rose Rocket Summer Challenge 2020

## Scheduler App

This app has been designed as my entry into the Summer Challenge.

It is written in React with the [react-csv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-csv) library being used to render the CSV download file. 

# Usage

Click on the empty squares in the grid to begin adding new tasks to the schedule. You can also click on a created task to edit the data within it, including the driver, location and description. If a location and description are used, they will appear within the task created.
